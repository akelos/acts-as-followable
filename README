Acts as Followable Plugin
===================================
This plugin allows you to follow and unfollow Models.
It will keep your followers list, your following list and your friends list (people you follow and that follow you).

define the act in your model:

class User extends ActiveRecord
{

    var $acts_as = array('followable');
    
}

and start following:

$paul->follow($frank);

Paul is now following frank:

echo $paul->isFollowing($frank);
// true

Frank is followed by Paul:
echo $frank->isFollowedBy($paul);
// true
...

$frank will now be in your following list:

echo $paul->followings[0]->name;
// frank

if $frank follows $paul, they become friends:

$frank->follow($paul);

echo $frank->isFriendOf($paul);
// true

echo $frank->friends[0]->name;
// paul
